| cq703  | - | the most stable simulation for the LGM,This suite is based on nearly the LGM boundary condition, but the Southern Hemisphere (S60-S90) uses a modern land-sea mask with LGM topography because the LGM model errors originated from the Southern Ocean (very close to Antarctica). from cj841|archer2|

diff -ur cj788 cj345

  +um_sources=branches/pkg/Share/vn10.7_CMIP6_production_mods@43043
```
the pathes in fact means the codes stored in the repository: **fcm:um.xm**
```
fcm ls fcm:um.xm/branches/dev/kenjiizumi/vn10.7_orbital_21k
```
checkout it by fcm co fcm:um.xm/branches/dev/kenjiizumi/vn10.7_orbital_21k
the next step is to compare these two resource directory.
