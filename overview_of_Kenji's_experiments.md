| cq703  | - | the most stable simulation for the LGM,This suite is based on nearly the LGM boundary condition, but the Southern Hemisphere (S60-S90) uses a modern land-sea mask with LGM topography because the LGM model errors originated from the Southern Ocean (very close to Antarctica).|archer2|
| co328  | - | full LGM simulation, crashed every 2-5 years  |archer2|
| db646  | - | HadGEM3-GC3.1 - the LGM simulation with the ozone remapping scheme after ARCHER2 OS upgrade |archer2|
