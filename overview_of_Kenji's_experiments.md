| cb392  | - | N96ORCA1 PI Control for testing ice-berg input data |
| by975  | - | PI Control for CMIP6 WITH LGM orbits and CO2 |
| bz669  | - | PI LSM, LGM GHGs, orbit & icesheets |
| cq703  | - | the most stable simulation for the LGM,This suite is based on nearly the LGM boundary condition, but the Southern Hemisphere (S60-S90) uses a modern land-sea mask with LGM topography because the LGM model errors originated from the Southern Ocean (very close to Antarctica).|
| co328  | - | full LGM simulation, crashed every 2-5 years  |
